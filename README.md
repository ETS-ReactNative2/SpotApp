# Product Vision

This product will classify dog images by breeds and store the photos into a personal database. Each photo will be associated with its breed and will display general information about the breed along with if that breed is available at local shelters. The user's account will store the pictures they have taken and the associated breeds.

We are creating this product for both education and entertainment. It can aid in animal shelters and dog rescues by raising awareness of dogs in the local community. It is a project that would be educational while still making it exciting for people to use. For us, it would be a great project to work on as we would get experience in front- and back-end development and machine learning.

This project would benefit people of all ages, as it is both educational and enjoyment. It encourages going outside, meeting people, and helping local shelters. By suggesting local shelters, we enforce adopting dogs rather than going through breeders; the app also would allow for people to compete with each other to collect the most breeds.

Most apps on the market strictly identify a dog breed, ours would not only suggest the most likely breed, but allows for people to collect different dog breeds and associate the breed with local shelters and give you information about that breed. Our app acts as a expandable digital encyclopedia.

**note**: For this sprint, I am anticipating that you will continue to work on the stories carried over from Sprint 1, with a focus on the design aspect of your system. I am expecting your architecture document and diagrams to reflect the system only in the context of these user stories, with some generalization to help plan for the other items currently in the backlog. I am not expecting a significant amount of implementation at this point, if any at all.

**note**: At this point I am expecting that you have designed out a few of the initial user stories and started to implement this. From this point forward there should be continuous integration and deployment, producing working software that is demoed at the end of each sprint.
